<h1>The best Movies according to Djille</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>1. Shawshank Redemption</h3>
<p>
    I loved The Shawshank Redemption because it’s a powerful story of hope and perseverance, showing how the human spirit can triumph even in the darkest situations. The bond between Andy and Red felt so genuine, and the ending left me with such a profound sense of justice and freedom.

<h3>2. The Green Mile</h3>
<p>
    The Green Mile moved me deeply with its mix of humanity and the supernatural. The connection between the characters, especially Paul and John Coffey, made me think about kindness, redemption, and the complexity of justice. It left me in awe of how even the most unexpected people can bring light into a dark world.

<h3>3. Cast Away</h3>
<p>
    And Cast Away was such an emotional rollercoaster for me. Watching Chuck’s struggle to survive and adapt on the island felt so raw and real, and it made me appreciate the small things in life. When he finally returned home, his transformation and loss were heartbreaking but deeply inspiring - it’s a movie that stayed with me long after it ended
